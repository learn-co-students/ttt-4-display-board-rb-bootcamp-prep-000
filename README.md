# Displaying a Tic Tac Toe Board

## Overview

A tic tac toe board can be represented by an array of 9 string elements containing the state of that cell in the board.

An empty board would be:

```ruby
board = [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
```

If we called `display_board` and passed in that `board` as an argument, we'd expect the following:

```ruby
board = [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
display_board(board)

# Would Print:
#    |   |   
# -----------
#    |   |   
# -----------
#    |   |   
```

A board with an "X" in the middle:

```ruby
board = [" ", " ", " ", " ", "X", " ", " ", " ", " "]
display_board(board)

# Would Print:
#    |   |   
# -----------
#    | X |   
# -----------
#    |   |   
```

In these examples, the data from `board` is being used within the `display_board` method to print a board based on the current values in the `board` array passed to it as an argument. Here are a few more examples.

A board with X winning via filling the top row:
```ruby
board = ["X", "X", "X", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
```
If that `board` was passed to `display_board`, we'd expect this to print:

```
 X | X | X
-----------
   |   |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

Or think about a random board after 5 turns:

```ruby
board = ["O", "X", " ", " ", "X", " ", "X", "O", " "]
```

That `board` as an argument to `display_board` should print:

```
 O | X |   
-----------
   | X |   
-----------
 X | O |   
```   

Or a board entirely filled with "O":
```ruby
board = ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"]
```
Would print:
```
 O | O | O
-----------
 O | O | O
-----------
 O | O | O
```   

Etc...

Our goal is to build a method `display_board` that accepts a board array as an argument and uses the data in that array to correctly print out an accurate representation of the Tic Tac Toe board from the player's perspective based on the data in the array.

For example, given a correctly defined `display_board`:

```ruby
board = ["O", "X", " ", " ", "X", " ", "X", "O", " "]
display_board(board)
```

Should print:
```
 O | X |   
-----------
   | X |   
-----------
 X | O |   
```

The board follows the following format:

1. When the board is displayed there are three characters per cell. An empty cell is <code>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</code> and a filled cell is `" X "`
2. Three cells per a row.
3. The middle cell in a row is bordered by 2 `|` (pipes): ` O | X |   `
4. Three rows on the board.
5. Rows are separated by: `-----------`

> Note: If you've built the blank tic tac toe board in a previous lab, you may want to go back and copy it in to this lab. Feel free to also re-create the board from scratch.

### Building Dynamic Strings with Interpolation

Don't forget that in Ruby you can interpolate data into a string using the `"#{1+1}"` interpolation syntax. For example:

```ruby
puts "#{1+1}" #> "2" will print because ruby evaluates the code within the {}
puts "1+1" #> "1+1" will print because ruby treats "1+1" as a string.
```

With variables, interpolation looks like:

```ruby
x = 1+1
puts "#{x}" #> "2" will print because ruby evaluates the code within the {}
puts "x" #> "x" will print because ruby treats "x" as a string not a variable.
```

In the context of an array, like you'll be dealing with in `board`, you'll have to do something like:

```ruby
colors = ["Red","Yellow", "Green"]
puts "The first color is #{colors[0]}"
#> "The first color is Red" will print because ruby evaluates colors[0]
```

Make sure to be interpolating data from the `board` array within your `display_board` method. This is essential to solving this lab, to evolve from a permanently empty skeleton board as you did before to an _actual_ board that contains live player movement throughout the game.

## Objectives

1. Define a method that accepts an argument.
2. Use the argument within the method.
3. Read data from an array.
4. Print out a multi-line dynamic string using Interpolation

## Instructions

1. Define your `display_board` method in `lib/display_board.rb`
2. Get the test suite passing by running `learn`
3. Submit your solution.

## Hint: The `rspec --fail-fast` test flag

To ensure that your `display_board` method honestly works as expected, we had to write a lot of tests to flex the different situations that might occur. When you run `learn`, you're going to see lots of failing tests that are all basically failing for the same reason - `display_board` isn't behaving as desired. It might be easier to deal with one test failure at a time and scrolling through the output of 12 failures isn't helpful.

You can limit your test run to stop at the first failure it encounters so that you only see 1 failure and can easily focus on it. By focusing on a single failure, you can quickly change your method based on that failure and re-run the test suite and see if the change solved that single failure. Although this lengthens the command each time, you can instantly redo your last entered command by tapping the Up arrow on your keyboard so you don't have to type the whole thing each time.

It's helpful, for example:
